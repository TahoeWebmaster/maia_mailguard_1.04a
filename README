This version of maia mailguard has been tested on Centos 7. 

It should be easy to adapt to Suse or Debian-based dstros, but the 
initial focus on Centos 7, and openvz containers is the target platform.

Scripts to install this mailguard release on other Linux distros wll be 
happily accepted. In the meantime, it can be installed on other distros 
via the manual procedure.

Instructions: (this will evolve as we test and refine the process)

For Centos 7, run the script "install-centos7.sh"

For all other distros, one can puzzle through the manual procedure in the
contrib directory, which, though written for maia 1.0.2, which used
amavisd-new, replaced by maiad in the current version, still contains
the gist of what is needed. It will eventually be brought up to date
as well. 

Contributions are welcome.
